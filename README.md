# Neovim Config ðŸ’»

This is my initial Neovim configuration, set up with the help of a few YouTube tutorials. Right now, it's quite basic, but it gives me the foundation to explore and understand how Neovim works.

As I get more familiar and figure out my specific needs, this configuration will evolve and become more personalized to my workflow. ðŸ‘¾
